            <h2>About Joshua</h2>
            <p>Having over 10 + years experience working in the restaurant
                industry, I have worked with all types of proffessionals and 
                hobbyist. I find that there is a gap in technology when it comes
                to the culinary industry.
                
                I am going to <a href="">Thinkful</a> to grow and develop as a programmer
                and make more of my ideas come alive. I also want to make a permanent career change.
        
                Because of my passing for programming I know Thinkful is the right choice 
                in pursuing my goals</p>
